# ü•∏ Insider Threat Simulation (14-Day Log)

This repository contains a 14-day simulation in which I documented real-world insider threat vulnerabilities observed in a healthcare-adjacent workplace environment. The entries focus on **physical security**, **compliance awareness**, and **human behavior risks** commonly overlooked in HIPAA-regulated spaces.

The purpose of this project was to strengthen my ability to:

- Conduct internal security observations
- Identify risks related to physical access and personnel habits
- Practice writing professional risk assessments and mitigation strategies
- Present speculative threat modeling from an insider perspective

Each daily entry includes:
- A specific risk or security gap observed
- A threat analysis section ("Speculative Insider Perspective")
- Recommendations tailored for low-impact, realistic improvements
- A severity rating to help prioritize remediation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer (PLEASE READ)

This project is a **personal simulation and learning exercise** in the field of cybersecurity and insider threat modeling. The following clarifications apply to the entire repository:

- **No actions were taken** during this simulation that could alter, interfere with, or compromise systems, data, or personnel in any way.
- All entries are based on **passive observation only** ‚Äî no technical tools, exploits, or unauthorized access methods were used.
- Where speculative language is used (e.g., "If I were a malicious insider..."), it is solely intended to demonstrate an understanding of threat modeling and adversarial thinking from an ethical, educational standpoint.
- All sensitive names, system references, and proprietary information have been omitted or redacted.
- This project **does not represent or reflect the views of any employer**, organization, or third party.
- **No data was exfiltrated, altered, or accessed**. All insights were gathered from **visual cues**, public/common areas, or internal documentation that I was authorized to view in my normal duties.

This simulation was performed **independently** and **ethically**, in accordance with professional standards and a commitment to security education.
